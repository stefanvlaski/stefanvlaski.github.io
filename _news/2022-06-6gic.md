I am speaking on "Decentralised Learning in Non-Convex Environments" at the ["6GIC-CLICK Wireless AI"](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/spotlight-wireless-ai-6gic-selected-advanced-topics-workshop-series) workshop hosted by the University of Surrey. **Update:** A recording is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/toOran-6sMg?t=1849).
