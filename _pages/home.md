I am Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I am part of the [Communication and Signal Processing Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/comms-and-signal-processing/) within the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/).

My research interests focus around the intersection of machine learning (theory), optimization and network science. More details are available under the Research tab.

Before joining Imperial in 2021, I was Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Adaptive Systems Laboratory](https://asl.epfl.ch) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. I obtained my PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2019, and completed my undergraduate degree with the [Signal Processing Group](https://www.spg.tu-darmstadt.de/spg/index.en.jsp) at the Technical University, Darmstadt in Germany in 2013. A formal biography as well as academic CV are available here.

== Prospective Students
I am always looking for driven students and postdocs to work with. Please check the [openings.html \[Openings\]] tab for details.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
