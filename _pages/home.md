I am Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I am part of the [Communication and Signal Processing Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/comms-and-signal-processing/) within the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/).

My research interests focus around the intersection of machine learning (theory), optimization and network science. More details are available under the publications tab.

Before joining Imperial in 2021, I was Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Adaptive Systems Laboratory](https://asl.epfl.ch/) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. I obtained my PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2019, and completed my undergraduate degree with the [Signal Processing Group](https://www.spg.tu-darmstadt.de/spg/index.en.jsp) at the Technical University, Darmstadt in Germany in 2013. A formal biography as well as academic CV are available [here](https://stefanvlaski.github.io/assets/pdf/vlaski_cv.pdf).

> I am always looking for driven students and postdocs to work with. Please check the openings tab for details.
