If you are interested in working with me, please take some time to browse through our group's publications. The best way forward will then depend on the position you are aiming for:


bachelor and master students
-----
I work with a number of Imperial students each year for their thesis projects. Students lead their own project within our broader research program, and successful projects often lead to publications. Student projects are advertised during the autumn term, so if you are an Imperial student, keep an eye out for the relevant communications from course directors. If you would like to self-propose a project, feel free to send me an email.



PhD students
-----
**I currently have an opening for one fully funded international PhD studentship.** Additionally, Imperial offers a number of prestigious scholarships each year including [college-wide](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/) and [departmental](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/phd/funding-and-scholarships/) schemes. If you would like to work with me while pursuing a PhD at Imperial, you will need to apply through the [central system](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/phd/) and list my name as potential supervisor. If you would like to discuss research and potential projects prior to applying, please send me an email and make sure to include a CV as well as a couple of paragraphs on topics you would be interested in exploring.



postdocs
-----
I currently do not have funded openings for postdoctoral positions. There are a number of prestigious fellowships available by Imperial and funding agencies including the [Imperial College Research Fellowship](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-office/funder-information/research-fellowships/icrf/) , [EPSRC Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-postdoctoral-fellowship/) and [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships/). If our research interests align and you would like me to support one of these applications, please send me and email and include a CV as well as a couple of paragraphs on the project you would like to propose.
